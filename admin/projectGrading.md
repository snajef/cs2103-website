#### Feature fit:

- ( ) `low`: One of these
  * target user is too general %%&nbsp;i.e. wider than AB4%%
  * target user and/or value proposition not clear from the user guide
  * features don't seem to fit together for the most part
- ( ) `medium`: Some features fit together but some don't.
- ( ) `high`: All features fit together but the features are not very high value to the target user.
- ( ) `excellent`: The target user is clearly defined (not too general) and almost all new features are of high-value to the target user. i.e. the product is very attractive to the target user.


#### Demo quality:

- [ ] Started with good overview
- [ ] Reasonable flow
- [ ] No evidence of 'winging it' (i.e., some level of prior planning is evident)
- [ ] Used realistic data
- [ ] Used enough test data
- [ ] Finished within time
